# Household-Heating-in-New-Zealand
The aim of this report was to analyse the advantages and disadvantages of the New Zealand government’s proposed strategy of subsidising 20% of heat pump (HP) installation costs for 20% of the population that use wood burners and fireplaces as their main source of heating. Through this analysis, the sensibility of the proposed strategy had to be found.

The research required for this report was conducted using statistics primarily from New Zealand government organisations such as the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, StatsNZ, etc. 

The benefits of this strategy included: 

• Potential elimination of 972557 to 1021185 tonnes of CO2, 102374 to 107493 tonnes of Nitrogen Dioxide and 35831 to 37623 tonnes of methane from the air per year resulting in improved overall air quality. 

• Giving Kiwis a difference of up to $196 in their annual energy bill when switching to heat pumps. 

The primary setbacks included substantial cost towards the government due to the subsidy and the additional load on the electricity grid requiring a greater dependence on nonrenewable resources to meet demand in a short space of time.
